                "Beijing" is from pinyin Běijīng, which is romanized from 北京, the Chinese name for this city. The<br>
                pinyin system of transliteration was approved by the Chinese government in 1958, but little used until<br>
                1979. It was gradually adopted by various news organizations, governments, and international agencies<br> 
                over the next decade.

                The Chinese characters 北 ("north") and 京 ("capital") together mean the "Northern Capital". The name<br>
                was first used during the reign of the Ming dynasty's Yongle Emperor, who made his northern fief a<br> 
                second capital, along with Nanjing (南京, the "Southern Capital"), in 1403 after successfully dethroning<br>
                his nephew during the Jingnan Campaign. The name was restored in 1949 at the founding of the People's <br>
                Republic of China.
