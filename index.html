            <p>Beijing, Wade-Giles romanization Pei-ching, conventional Peking, city, province-level shi (municipality),<br>
                and capital of the People’s Republic of China. Few cities in the world have served for so long as the<br>
                political headquarters and cultural centre of an area as immense as China. The city has been an integral<br>
                part of China’s history over the past eight centuries, and nearly every major building of any age in<br> 
                Beijing has at least some national historical significance. The importance of Beijing thus makes it <br>
                impossible to understand China without a knowledge of this city.</p>
