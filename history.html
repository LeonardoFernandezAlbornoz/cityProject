                In this article we will talk about some of the most relevant moments in the history of the city of Beijing<br>
                as well as some of its legends.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beijing was the capital city China during the Liao (916-1125), Jin (1115-1234), Yuan (1271-1368), Ming <br>
                (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties and is one of the four ancient capitals of China together with<br>
                Xian, Luoyang and Nanjing. The history of Beijing could be traced back to 500,000 years ago to the first<br> 
                existence of humans in this area.

                <p>
                    Evidence of our human ancestry dating back to 500,000 years ago has been found in such places as<br>
                    Zhoukoudian in the southwest part of Beijing, where the remains known as 'Peking Man' were found.

                </header>

                <p>
                    Beijing was built as early as 3,000 years ago and rebuilt and named Ji City in the Western Zhou Dynasty<br>
                    (11th century BC - 771 BC). Emperor Qin united China in 221 BC and built roads which connect Ji City<br>
                    with Xianyang - the capital during the Qin Dynasty. Ji City became the trading center and militarily<br>
                    strategic place in Northern China since that time. The name Ji City was used until the Sui Dynasty <br>
                    (581-618) when it was renamed Zhuo shire and You Zhou in Tang Dynasty (618-907).

                </header>
                
                <p>
                    The minority ethnic group Qidan occupied You Zhou and built Liao Dynasty (916-1125). You Zhou was<br>
                    called Yanjing at that time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Early in the 12th century, another minority ethnic group Nvzhen founded the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234),<br>
                    with its capital in Yanjing and renamed it Zhongdu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Jin Dynasty, the city was rebuilt on a scale similar to the Northern Song (960-1127) capital<br>
                    at Bianliang and expanded to the east, west and south. The new expanded city, with its splendid<br>
                    buildings in the center, measured roughly five kilometers in circumference, which forms the layout<br>
                    of Beijing we see today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Liao and Jin Dynasty, Beijing has become a truly significant capital.<br>

                <p>
                    Mongol armies occupied Zhongdu in 1215 and in 1271, the Mongols finally eliminated the Southern Song<br>
                    and unified China to build Yuan Dynasty. The leader of the Mongolian ethnic minority Kublai Khan<br>
                    established its capital in Yanjing and renamed it Dadu. Dadu became the political center of the country<br>
                    for the first time in history.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The magnificent palaces of the Jin capital, Zhongdu, were destroyed by fire during the dynastic<br>
                    turnover from Jin to Yuan. The emperor Kublai Khan ordered a new city to be built. The reconstruction<br>
                    lasted for 26 years and the original site of Zhongdu was replaced by a larger rectangular area centered<br>
                    in a beautiful lake region in the northeast suburbs of Zhongdu. The envoys and traders from Europe,<br>
                    Asia and Africa were astounded by the splendor and magnificence of Dadu and Dadu was famed as one of<br>
                    the most beautiful cities in the world at that time.

                    <h3>Beijing (Ming Dynasty – Qing Dynasty - the People's Republic of China)</h3>

                <p>
                    In 1368, Ming troops seized Dadu and renamed it Beiping (Northern Peace). In 1403, Emperor Zhu Di named<br>
                    Beiping as the capital and renamed it Beijing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extensive reconstruction work was carried out in Beijing during the first years of the Ming Dynasty. The<br>
                    most significant part of the reconstruction was to build an Inner City that was to serve as the capital<br>
                    of the Chinese empire and symbolize the supreme royalty. Designed with thousands of halls and gates<br>
                    arranged symmetrically around the north–south axis, the Inner City constructed in the Ming Dynasty is the<br>
                    Forbidden City at present in Beijing. Its dimensions and luxuriance are a fitting symbol of the power and<br>
                    greatness of these royal families. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the Manchus founded the Qing Dynasty in 1644, they also named Beijing as the capital and began to<br>
                    build royal gardens in western suburbs. The Summer Palace, Old Summer Palace and many other gardens were<br>
                    built at that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, China fell prey to the Northern Warlords and Kuomintang.<br>
                    It wasn't until October 1st, 1949 that the People's Republic of China was founded with Beijing as its<br>
                    capital.
