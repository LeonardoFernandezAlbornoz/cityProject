                <p>The design of the National Emblem of the People’s Republic of China shows Tian’anmen. Tian’anmen Square<br>
                    is at the center of Beijing. It is spread across an area of 440,000 square meters can host a grand gathering<br>
                    of one million people. It is the largest city square and one of the important monuments in Beijing. In 1949,<br>
                    Chairman Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People’s Republic of China from the Tian’anmen rostrum.<br>
                    The Mausoleum of Mao Zedong is at the south of the square; where Chairman Mao’s body lies in a crystal<br>
                    coffin. Tian’anmen has been popular for various important events in Chinese history. It, therefore, has a<br>
                    high status in the hearts of many Chinese people.

                    <h3>Great Wall of China</h3>
                </header>
    
                <p>The Great Wall of China is one of the most visited sites and famous monuments in Beijing in the country of<br>
                    China. The section that is usually visited by most tourists is the first part, which has a completely rebuilt<br>
                    wall and is closest to the center of Beijing.</p>

                    </header>
        
                    <p>This stretch has a unique landscape for two reasons: One, is the lack of people, since its conditions and<br>
                        remoteness are not very visited, and the other reason is its status: The wall remains how it was, with no<br>
                        reconstructions or additions. It is highly recommended for those who want to see things as they were and<br>
                        do not mind walking in-between rubble.</p>
